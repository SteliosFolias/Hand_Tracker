# Hand_Tracker
Hand Cursor Control is a lightweight Python application that runs in the background on Windows and uses your webcam to track your hand. It moves the mouse cursor based on your index finger and supports stable, gesture-based left and right clicks without a graphical interface. It's built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI.
